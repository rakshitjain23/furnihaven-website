How I Used ChatGPT to Develop Furnihaven-
While building Furnihaven, I used ChatGPT extensively to assist in the development process:

(1) Code Generation and Troubleshooting: ChatGPT helped generate code snippets for JavaScript and CSS, including implementing libraries like ScrollReveal for smooth scrolling animations. It also provided solutions for debugging and resolving coding issues.

(2) Responsive Design and Optimization: ChatGPT provided guidance on creating responsive layouts using CSS media queries and optimizing the website's performance. It offered tips to improve code efficiency and ensure the site was user-friendly on all devices.

(3) Design and Content Ideas: I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for website content, including taglines and product descriptions, and to get advice on modern web design principles to enhance the siteâ€™s aesthetics.

By leveraging ChatGPT, I streamlined the development process and enhanced the overall quality of the website.
